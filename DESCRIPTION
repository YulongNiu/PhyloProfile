Package: PhyloProfile
Title: A package for phylogenetic profiling analysis
Description: It contains various analysis methods and visualization of phylogenetic profiles.
    Methods include co-occurrency (Jaccard similarity, Pearson correlation coefficient, mutual information,
    Hamming distance, and Euclidean distance), model-based methods(maximum likelihood from "BayesTrait" and
    Dollo parsimony distance), and normalization (NPP and SVD). Visualization techniques consist of phylogenetic
    profile, correlation matrix, configures of Circos plot, and D3 network. Retrieving phylogenetic profile
    from the STRING database. Downstream analysis includes expanding known gene-sets, significant gene-set
    analysis.
