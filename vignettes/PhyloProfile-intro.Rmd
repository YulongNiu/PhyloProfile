# Introduction

Phylogenetic profiling is a bioinformatic technique used to show protein presence and absence across a large number of species. This genomic-context method is based on the assumption that functionally related proteins are likely to evolve in a correlated manner [@pellegrini1999assigning]. It has been successfully applied to detect novel physical protein-protein interactions, new components of biological complexes, and potential linkages in signaling pathways or metabolic processes [@kensche2008practical].

As increasing numbers of sequenced genomes have become available, various online tools and databases has been developed [@cheng2015protphylo; @sadreyev2015phylogene; @ott2012napp; @szklarczyk2014string; @cromar2016phylopro2]. However, systematically analysis of user-defined phylogenetic profile on local computers is still a slow and tedious process. Here, we provided a R package named *[PhyloProfile](https://github.com/YulongNiu/PhyloProfile)* for analyzing and visualizing phylogenetic profiles.

# Construction of phylogenetic profiles

In *[PhyloProfile](https://github.com/YulongNiu/PhyloProfile)*
, a profile with $n$ proteins across $m$ organisms is denoted as a $n \times m$ matrix containing either binning or continuous data. A binning matrix uses 0 and 1 to represent the homologies absence and presence, respectively. A continuous matrix usually consists of specific sequence similarities, for example BLAST bit scores, which need to be normalized before further analysis.

## Read profiles from local files

`PP()` is designed to coerce a matrix to a `PP` class object, for example we read a published profile [@barker2007constrained] stored in a csv-formed file. 

```{r}
library('PhyloProfile')
library('magrittr')

descPath <- system.file('extdata', package = 'PhyloProfile')
bioinfoPMat <- read.csv(file.path(descPath, 'bioinfoProfile.csv'), row.names = 1) %>% as.matrix
bioinfoP <- PP(bioinfoPMat)
bioinfoP
```
